# Human-emotion-Detection
This project implements a real-time emotion detection system using deep learning. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify emotions based on facial expressions. The system can either be trained on a dataset of facial images or used for real-time emotion detection through a webcam.
